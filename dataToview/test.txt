My friends asked me why. I told them my story. When I was a small boy, I was very weak. Once I was terribly ill. I had a high fever. My parents sent me to the hospital but the doctors could do nothing for me. Then my parents heard there was a very good doctor in another town. They took me there at once. I was saved.President Xi Jinping's call for inclusive and sustainable globalization received international recognition and support at the Boao Forum for Asia, with participants agreeing that greater inclusiveness and fairness are needed to ensure shared benefits and common prosperity.

Political leaders, academics and entrepreneurs from home and abroad attending the forum in Hainan province acknowledged China's role in not only defending globalization but also mobilizing coordinated efforts to address the problems and fix the flaws in the global economic system, observers said. The forum ended on Sunday.

In a letter, Xi called on forum participants to pool their wisdom to solve the major problems facing the world and regional economies and to push a more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable globalization process.

Xi said that the theme of the forum£­Globalization and Free Trade: The Asian Perspectives£­reflected the keen attention on the issue from the international community, especially in Asia.

The president lauded the role of the forum in building an Asian consensus, promoting Asian cooperation and upgrading Asian influence since its establishment 16 years ago.

Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli, in his keynote speech, stressed that Asian countries should collectively push for a more inclusive globalization, promote balanced and fair development and reform global economic governance.

Forum participants' statements showed their recognition that globalization is an inevitable trend and a natural outcome of scientific breakthroughs and technological progress that have enabled many countries to achieve substantial economic and social progress.

But they pointed out pressing issues such as widened inequality and fragmentation of global trade, which should not be neglected as trade and investment are liberalized.

In a joint declaration, members of the forum said that reversing globalization is unlikely to solve problems, and could even create new challenges for global growth. They agreed that the world must adapt to the globalization trend and reform global governance.

Former French prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said that multilateralism should increase the inclusiveness of globalization, warning that "ever-increasing" bilateral interactions could cause trade imbalances.

"We see the tendency of countries to go around multilateral systems such as the United Nations. If we want to ensure the inclusiveness of globalization, we need multilateral arrangements and all participants sitting at the table," he said.

Hans-Paul Burkner, chairman of the Boston Consulting Group, a US-based worldwide company, said globalization has benefited the majority of people in the world and countries should work together to promote fair trade and to address the challenges facing globalization.

"As we go forward, with tension and protectionist measures rising, we need to continue to open up and to encourage the fair exchange of goods and services as President Xi also mentioned ... and to make sure it is win-win," he said.

While recognizing the positive role of globalization, Nepali Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal noted that imbalances in its benefits are evidenced by the expressions in some countries of people feeling marginalized.

He said Asia is an ideal region to lead the next phase of globalization, and future efforts should focus on increasing inclusiveness to avoid dividing people into winners and losers.

Forum participants said they also agreed that stepping up domestic structural reforms, facilitating innovation to generate new businesses and jobs, and taking effective measures to deal with the cost of free trade will help solve problems in the globalized world.

Jin Liqun, president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, said that blaming globalization works in no one's interest and governments should improve their social and economic policies to address the downsides of globalization, such as the loss of jobs in some sectors.

Former US secretary of commerce Carlos Gutierrez pointed out that governments should focus on preparing for the rapid development of robotics and automation rather than blaming globalization as a cause of unemployment.

"The biggest threat in the future is not trade and globalization but robotics, as millions of jobs could be lost because of that. ... Governments should retrain people who lose their jobs so they can get new skills that will be relevant in the future," he said.The battle of colorful bicycles in China's bike-sharing market has turned fiercer.

The top two players, Mobike, which provides orange bikes, and its rival ofo (yellow bikes), are set for rapid growth.

Research firm QuestMobile's data shows Mobike had 978,600 daily active users in January, up 20.4 percent month-on-month, while ofo had 486,600, up 59 percent.

Penguin Intelligence, an internet-focused think tank affiliated to Tencent, said with the two startups' rapid growth, there is an increasingly high overlap between Mobike and Ofo users.

For instance, Mobike had 6.92 million registered users overall by January, of whom 1.22 million also used ofo bikes, up from 728,200 in December 2016.

Feng Chen, Penguin analyst, said in a report bike sharing has gained strong word of mouth and cultivated a high degree of user loyalty.

Bike sharing provides an additional choice for users' short trips, Feng said. "Catering to users' specific demands, it really offers better user experiences."

A Penguin survey of more than 6,000 smartphone users found 61.3 percent of the bike-on-demand service app users will travel less than 3,000 meters or 3 kilometers per ride, and 62.9 percent of the users will mainly commute from bus stations or subway stations to their destinations.

Of those surveyed, 48.7 percent said they would like to have more short trips using shared bicycles, and almost 60 percent accepted shared bikes as a better choice for travelling.

As more people choose to share bikes, they are encountering problems. Sometimes, there aren't adequate number of bikes available to rent. But in the long run, shared bikes will prove environmentally friendly, according to the survey report of Penguin.

Known as the "Kingdom of Bicycles" in the 1980s, China has grown to be the world's largest auto market. Now, bike sharing is expected to make bicycle-riding fashionable again. What's more, venture capital firms have funded startups providing bike-sharing services.

Since 2016, the Beijing-based Mobike, which is known for its distinctive GPS-equipped bikes, has landed several rounds of financing, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. And it has partnered with Foxconn Technology Group to double its annual bicycle production capacity to more than 10 million units.

Its record is not unique, as its rival ofo raised 3.1 million yuan ($450 million) in its latest round of funding in early March, which gave it a valuation of more than $1 billion.

Zhang Xu, analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys, predicted that the bike-sharing sector would see a shakeout by the end of this year and mergers, or some sort of consolidation or rationalization of existing players, may ensue in early 2018.The computer games itself is only a tool like knife.
